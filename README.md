The purpose of this challenge was to create an application that would generate a random password with the following criteria:

-Length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
	-whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
	-Prompted for password criteria
	-All prompts are answered
             -Password is generated that matches the selected criteria
             -The password is generated
             -The password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.

HTML and CSSs started codes were provided.
 I used JavaScript where I created variables for each password requirement.
I created functions to Generate prompts, write password and Generate a password.
